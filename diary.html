  <p style="color:red">Hello.</p>
  <p style="color:red">Why are you playing this Paper Minecraft version?</p>
    <p style="color:red">I'm not funny and make mistakes in the main page anymore. I'm depressed.</p>
      <p style="color:red">Couldn't you do something else like playing other games or go outside?</p>
        <p style="color:red">You want to meet me? Then fine.</p>
          <p style="color:red">I'm NOT a black skinned, now I'm a red-skinned now. Do you believe me?</p>
            <p style="color:red">Look at the player! You are just a dumb headless person lost in my glitchy dimension...</p>
              <p style="color:red">But hey, do you know who chopped your head? It's me. - Griffpatch.exe</p>
